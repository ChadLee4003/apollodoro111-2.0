# Apollodoro 111

Apollodoro 111 is an app dedicated to help people focus on their studies without being distracted from instant gratification.

Upon entering the app, you will be greeted by a home page with our app logo and **three buttons** leading to three different pages.

**The first button** leads you to a page with a timer. The timer will cycle between two periods: the study time and the break time. You can start and pause the timer whenever you want. You will also have the flexibility to choose how long your study and break time is by adding the minutes and seconds for study and break time in the box provided below the start and stop buttons. After clicking Set, it will update the timer once you exit and re-enter the app or wait for the next study or break time. 

**The second button** leads you to a page with a calender. Selecting a date on the timer would let you add anything on that date including homeworks that are due. This way, you will be able to see exactly when each assignment is due whilst being inside the app leading you to create good study habits. Also, if the assignment is finished or was put in by accident, there is a trash can icon to dispose of that event.

**The third button** leads you to a page with a circular progression bar and a badge with a number below it. The progression bar will show how far you are from earning your next badge. Every ten cycles of study and break time you do using the app would lead you to earning a badge. The badge count would be displayed right under the progression bar.
